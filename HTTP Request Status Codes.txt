PUT:
	- typically sends the entire updated representation of the resource and is used for full updates or creation.
	- If the resource doesn't exist at the specified URI, a new resource will be created.
	- replace object

PATCH: 
	- sends only the changes to the resource and is used for partial updates.
	- it includes only the changes to the resource, not the complete representation.
	- update some properties
