======== Mongodb database profiler  
	https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.3/tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler/

The embedded data model (objects and arrays inside object) combines all related data in a single document instead of normalizing across multiple documents and collections. 
This data model facilitates atomic operations.


--- In most cases, multi-document transaction incurs a greater performance cost over single document writes.

--- Indexes
   - Use indexes to improve performance for common queries. Build indexes on fields that appear often in queries and for all operations that return sorted results.
   - MongoDB automatically creates a unique index on the _id field.
   - Adding an index has some negative performance impact for write operations. For collections with high write-to-read ratio, 
	indexes are expensive since each insert must also update any indexes.

--- in this example, you better separate logs in different collectins (logs_dev ,logs_debug) instead of having types.
{ log: "dev", ts: ..., info: ... }
{ log: "debug", ts: ..., info: ...}


--- there are 2 way to model in mongodb database  
1- reference 
2- embed objects, arrays



--- what to do with data integrity?		ex: when in invoice lines an item name field if we change item name this should be changed too.
