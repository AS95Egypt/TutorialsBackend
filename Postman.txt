===== Documentation 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_bYRsbeyCc

- in postman add description to endpoints to clearify (params, query , body, response) in order to see it in the published link.

--- Create documentation link
1- click the collection you want to document 
2- click `view all documentaiton`
3- then click publish 
4- will direct you to postman web (set prefered options & settings) -> click publish
5- it will give a link to share and every time you update documentation in postman 
	and add more endpoints you will see changes after refresh the link.


==> How to see sample response in documentation ?
- save response as example and name this example 	ex: get user info [OK], get user info [Invalid ID] 
	and in the published web documenation you can preview these examples.


- make sure you make some responses, in order to view it in the documentation.


===> to change all collection endpoints from `https://`  to `{{httpType}}://` variable do this:
- click find and replace in lower app bar

- write in search https://
   choose where you want to search and open the relevant search tab

- write {{httpType}}:// in replace section, and select all then replace.


===> set api key & bearer token for all collection request in pre-request script

// set api key in all collection's requests
pm.request.headers.add({key: 'api-key', value: "{{apiKey}}" });
// set bearer token in all collection's requests
pm.request.headers.add({key: 'Authorization', value: 'Bearer '+'{{generatedAccessToken}}'});


===== OR BETTER 

// set api key in all collection's requests
const API_KEY = pm.variables.get('apiKey');
pm.request.headers.add({key: 'api-key', value: API_KEY });

// set bearer token in all collection's requests
const TOKEN = pm.variables.get('generatedAccessToken');
pm.request.headers.add({key: 'Authorization', value: 'Bearer '+ TOKEN});

===> get variable in postman
const TOKEN = pm.variables.get('generatedAccessToken');
