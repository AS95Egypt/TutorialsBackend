PM2: 
  - allow you to manage application with ease, restart them automatically when they crash.
  - deploy application to multiple services with zero downtime.  (many instances of the same app)
  - provides a build in load balancer, to automatically restart the application when they crash. 

  - PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. 
	It allows you to keep applications alive forever, 
	to reload them without downtime, and to facilitate common system admin tasks.

--- install pm2 globally
	npm i -g pm2

--- Disadvantages of running the application in the normal way:
 1- when you run your API the normal way and close the terminal the application stops.
 2- you have to open new tab or terminal window in order to continue execute commands. 

--- Solve problem (cannot run pm2 scripts):
when tryingto execute any pm2 nodejs package commands in the terminal i got this error:
"..\pm2.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on
this system."

  1- run terminal (not cmd) as Administrator
  2- Check the Current Execution Policy			Get-ExecutionPolicy
  3- Change Execution policy to RemoteSigned		Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  4- check if policy changed				Get-ExecutionPolicy


--- start the application using pm2
  1- change directory to project root
  2- run 	`pm2 start server.js`


--- restart the application
  pm2 restart appid/name

--- stop the application
  pm2 stop appid/name

--- show application logs
  pm2 logs appid/name

--- to list all running services using pm2
   `pm2 status`
or `pm2 ls`  

--- to preview performance metrices
 `pm2 monit`

--- run two instances of the same app 
	pm2 start server.js --name forumApp

--- delete existing service
	pm2 delete forumApp

--- delete all services
	pm2 delete all

--- enable watching when starting the app
	pm2 start 0 --watch
  `--watch` flag means 
	PM2 will monitor the files in the application's directory for changes, and if it detects any modifications, 
	it will automatically restart the application.
     - you should do this in development only.

--- create process from package.json
in package.json
   	"prodStart": "pm2 start server.js",
in terminal
	npm run prodStart

--- NOTE: in production the app should be in Cluster mode not  in Fork mode.

--- run pm2 processes using configuration file

--- Difference between fork and cluster
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34682035/cluster-and-fork-mode-difference-in-pm2

--- start the process in cluster mode 
	pm2 start app.js -i 0
