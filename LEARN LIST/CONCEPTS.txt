=== what is the difference between ORM, ODM?
(Object Relational Mapper)
MySQL is an example of a relational database 
- you would use an ORM to translate between your objects in code and the relational representation of the data.

Examples of ORMs are nHibernate, Entity Framework, Dapper and more...


(Object Document Mapper)
MongoDB is an example of a document database 
- you would use an ODM to translate between your objects in code and the document representation of the data (if needed).

Mandango is an example of an ODM for MongoDB.


===== N+1 queries 
 are a performance problem in which the application makes database queries in a loop,
 instead of making a single query that returns or modifies all the information at once.

===== How to sum binary numbers
pad left first the shortest operand with leading zeros
ex: a= 11, b= 100	then a becomes 011

start adding from the right

1+1=0 with carry 1
1+0=1 with carry 0
0+1=1 with carry 0
0+0=0 with carry 0
Imp:1+1=1 with carry 1 if previous carry was 1.
The carry gets added in next step(scanning from right to left).

- If you have a carry left at the end of the addition, write it down as the leftmost bit of the result.
ex: 
   1011
 +  110
-------
  10001

===== soft delete: 
marks a record as no longer active or valid without actually deleting it from the database.

===== *** Microservices

===== *** Serverless

===== Replay attack

===== Caching 
	is the ability to store copies of frequently accessed data in several places along the request-response path.

===== DNS resolution
	mapping a web address to an IP address

===== Eager loading & Lazy loading


===== 
Reverse proxy server: sitting in front of web servers and forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend servers. This helps in load balancing, caching, and enhancing security.

Load balancer: distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, improving performance, fault tolerance, and scalability of web applications.

===== Common practice is to also set CORS settings Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings are important for web security. 
	They control which domains can access your API, preventing unwanted cross-site interactions.
