=== what is the difference between ORM, ODM?
(Object Relational Mapper)
MySQL is an example of a relational database 
- you would use an ORM to translate between your objects in code and the relational representation of the data.

Examples of ORMs are nHibernate, Entity Framework, Dapper and more...


(Object Document Mapper)
MongoDB is an example of a document database 
- you would use an ODM to translate between your objects in code and the document representation of the data (if needed).

Mandango is an example of an ODM for MongoDB.


===== N+1 queries 
 are a performance problem in which the application makes database queries in a loop,
 instead of making a single query that returns or modifies all the information at once.

===== How to sum binary numbers
pad left first the shortest operand with leading zeros
ex: a= 11, b= 100	then a becomes 011

start adding from the right

1+1=0 with carry 1
1+0=1 with carry 0
0+1=1 with carry 0
0+0=0 with carry 0
Imp:1+1=1 with carry 1 if previous carry was 1.
The carry gets added in next step(scanning from right to left).

- If you have a carry left at the end of the addition, write it down as the leftmost bit of the result.
ex: 
   1011
 +  110
-------
  10001

===== soft delete: 
marks a record as no longer active or valid without actually deleting it from the database.

===== *** Microservices

===== *** Serverless

===== Replay attack

===== Caching 
	is the ability to store copies of frequently accessed data in several places along the request-response path.

===== DNS resolution
	mapping a web address to an IP address

===== Eager loading & Lazy loading


===== 
Reverse proxy server: sitting in front of web servers and forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend servers. This helps in load balancing, caching, and enhancing security.

Load balancer: distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, improving performance, fault tolerance, and scalability of web applications.

===== API gateway
- examples:  (Amazon API gateway, Azure API management, Goolge API gateway, Cloudflare)
- its a single point of entry for client applications
- its sits between clients and collection of backend services.
-- API Gateway provides: 
	- authentication and security policy enforcement
	- load balancing and circuit breaking
	- protocol transalation and service discovery
	- monitoring, logging, analytics and billing
	- ratelimiting
	- caching
	- allow/deny IP like cors
- api gateway forwards requests to right services by path matching and service discovery
===== Circuit Breaker pattern

===== Test-driven development (TDD)

===== multiplexing and server push.

===== Common practice is to also set CORS settings Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings are important for web security. 
	They control which domains can access your API, preventing unwanted cross-site interactions.

===== Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- is an approach to software development that emphasizes the understanding of business domains 
	and designing software that reflects the complexity of that domain. 

- It encourages close collaboration between domain experts (business owners & developers)
- DDD is ideal for complex business applications where the domain logic is the most important part of the system. 
	It helps build systems that evolve with business needs.

===== Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
- is a software architecture that aims to isolate the core business 
	logic from external systems like databases, UI, and APIs.  
- The idea is to allow different layers of the system to communicate 
	through well-defined interfaces (ports) and implementations (adapters).

- Decoupling: The business logic is decoupled from technical concerns like databases or user interfaces. 
	This makes the system more flexible and maintainable.
- enabling easier unit testing and flexibility in switching technologies 
	(e.g., switching databases or UI frameworks).

-  is useful in applications where you want to achieve high separation 
	between business logic and external dependencies

===== DAL: data access layer
- It is a part of the application's architecture that provides an abstraction between 
	the application's business logic and the underlying database or data storage system.

===== Stdout 
or standard output, is the default file descriptor where a computer program writes its output. 
It is one of the three standard streams, along with stdin (standard input) and stderr (standard error), 
which are used for input, output, and error handling in a program.

===== APM (Applicaiton monitoring and performance) 
is the monitoring and management of performance and availability of software applications. 
APM strives to detect and diagnose complex application performance problems 
to maintain an expected level of service. 

===== Code smells
The detection of "code smells" refers to identifying indicators in the source code that suggest deeper issues or potential problems. 
Code smells are not bugs but rather signs that the code may be poorly structured or could lead to future maintenance difficulties.
Examples of code smells include long methods, duplicate code, excessive comments, 
and complicated class hierarchies. Detecting these smells helps developers improve code quality, 
enhance readability, and simplify future updates.
