=========== Tips
-  some algorisms (DFS, BFS, Sliding window, backtracing, union find, dijkstra's, sorting, hashmap, stack , queue, prim's)
- you should not solve dynamic programming problems unless you have solid understanding for backtracking
- also you have to know trees before solve graph problems.
- the order you solve problems with really matters.
- you have to figure what algorism should this problem solved with.

>> some mistakes to avoid 
- solving problems in random order
- don't waste too time trying to figure out a solution
- review previous problems, repetition is important

=========== Definitions
 in directed graph—the relationship is only one way.
 [topological sort] and it’s a way to make an ordered list out of a graph.

--- instead of using conditions to set max value you can use Math.max
        let currentArea = minHeigth * (j - i);
	if(currentArea > maxArea){
	   maxArea = currentArea;
	}

//replaced with
	maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, minHeigth * (j - i));



--- instead of using conditions use ternary operators

	count += vowels.includes(s.charAt(i)) ? 1 : 0;

--- check if map has duplicates in values 

let set = new Set(map.values());
  return set.size === map.size;  


--- how to map rows and columns to strings 
  const rows = grid.map((arr) => arr.join());
  const columns = grid[0].map((col, i) => grid.map((row) => row[i]).join());		//???

--- how to solve ` Removing Stars From a String` using stack 
https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/solutions/3404904/easy-and-explained-solution-in-java-javascript-c-and-python-o-n/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75


--- you can use continue instead of nesting conditions 
example:
	if (char !== "]") { stack.push(char); continue; }


--- you specify the start index to start search from in indexOf
arr.indexOf('D', i+1)


--- what is linkedlist 
A linked list is a data structure used to store a collection of elements, where each element (node) points to the next element in the list. 
It consists of nodes, and each node has two main parts: data 
(the value or payload of the node) and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. 
Linked lists come in various forms, with singly linked lists and doubly linked lists being two common types.

--- check if number if reverse of it
    var reverse = 0;
    var copy = x;

    while (copy > 0) {
      const digit = copy % 10;
      reverse = reverse * 10 + digit;
      copy = ~~(copy / 10);
    }

    return reverse == x;
