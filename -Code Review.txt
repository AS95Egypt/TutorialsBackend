1- All changes require at least one approval before getting committed to the codebase.

2- Make pull requests small and digestible so code reviews can be done quickly. 
	There shouldn’t be too many conceptual changes in a single PR.

3- PRs should be reviewed within 4 hours (at least one reviewer should respond). 
	If it’s been more than 4 hours, the engineer can add a comment to their 
	pull request that will send a notification to all reviewers requesting feedback.

4- Add context to the PR so a reviewer can easily understand what the PR is changing and why. 
	If there are any changes that affect the UI, there should be screenshots of the UI that show the change.

- Avoid redundancy in your comments; don’t write what you do, write why you do it.
